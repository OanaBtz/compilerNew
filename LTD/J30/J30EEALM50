4. Calculating and adding interest
:SKRSLUT
:SWISS8.
.sp 3mm
This section does not apply to your payment accounts - please see
'Addendum on payment services'.
.sp 3mm
A payment account is an account set up for the purpose of executing
payment transactions. Examples of payment accounts are your salary and
budget accounts.
.sp 3mm
A working day is a day when the payer's or the payee's relevant
provider which is involved in the execution of a payment transaction
is open as is required to execute a payment
transaction. Saturdays, Sundays, public holidays, Constitution
Day (5 June), Friday after Ascension Day, Christmas Eve and New Year's
Eve are non-working days at &BANKNAVN..
.sp 3mm
Every day, &BANKNAVN. calculates interest for each account as follows:
.sp 3mm
.kp off
.kp on
Balance x nominal interest/360.
.sp 3mm
All months are calculated as 30 days.
.sp 3mm
.kp off
.kp on
When determining the daily balance, &BANKNAVN. uses the interest date for
the transactions as a basis.
.sp 3mm
.kp off
.kp on
The interest date is the day on which a payment, disbursement or other
transaction affects the calculation of interest on an account.
.sp 3mm

&BANKNAVN., the interest date is (the first working day/working day after
the payment is made).
.sp 3mm
.kp off
.kp on
When cash is paid out to you on a cheque issued to you, the interest
date is (the working day/first working day after the disbursement is
made). The interest date for payment of this cheque into your account at
&BANKNAVN. is (the first working day after the payment is made/payment
date).
.sp 3mm
.kp off

When cash or a cheque is paid out to you from your account at
&BANKNAVN., the interest date is (the working day/first working day

.sp 3mm

Interest is added by adding the daily interest calculations and

(the day interest is added/first working day after interest is added).
.sp 3mm
.kp off

The interest added is stated in your passbook and on your account
statements or similar statements.

If your account becomes overdrawn or is used in conflict with the
agreement, &BANKNAVN. may charge overdraft interest/commission or
default interest and a fee for sending out reminder letters as well as
expenses for legal assistance in connection with debt collection etc.
.sp 3mm

The size of the reminder fee is specified in &BANKNAVN.'s reminder letter.

the individual defaulted claim specifically.
.sp 3mm
.kp off
.kp on
&BANKNAVN. may at any time choose, administratively and
financially, to cease the adding of interest on defaulted claims. Such
omission to add interest which has not been agreed with you
is not to be regarded as a waiver by &BANKNAVN. of the right to
charge interest on its claim and demand payment of any costs later
incurred. This applies irrespective of whether you are informed of
the bookkeeping method used via an account statement or otherwise.

.br
&BANKNAVN. may demand final settlement through netting in case of
breach, see Clause 9 of 'General Terms and Conditions of Business and
Special Conditions for Loans and Credits, Business Customers' (Breach
and other events of default).
.sp 5mm
.kp off
.kp on
.us 2. Balances which can be settled through netting
.br
Final settlement can be made of any existing and future commitment
(see, however, Clause 3) between you and &BANKNAVN., which involves the
right to:
.sp 3mm
.kp off
.kp on
.of 3mm
*¤cash settlement, including account balances, rights acquired on
assignment from a third party and claims acquired through cheques and
bills of exchange. Account balances exempt from legal action are not
included in the final settlement. Other claims are included in the
final settlement to the extent their payment can be demanded, including
as a result of breach or other event of default under this or other
agreements.

*¤a requirement for delivery of securities as defined in Section 2 of
the Danish Securities Trading Act (Værdipapirhandelsloven), among
other things the return of securities assigned to &BANKNAVN. for
purposes of ownership or pledge, including the return of
non-identified securities under a financial security agreement. The
return of securities that are kept solely by &BANKNAVN. cannot be

Requirements covered by framework agreements concluded between you and
&BANKNAVN. concerning currency, interest, index and security
transactions are settled finally under such agreements.
.sp 5mm
.kp off
.kp on
.us 4. Joint final settlement
.br
If the final settlement of commitments under framework agreements or
other agreements is carried out simultaneously with final settlement
under this provision, the balances under such agreements may, if so
requested by &BANKNAVN., be included in the final settlement under
this agreement, thus ensuring a joint final settlement.
.sp 3mm
.kp off
.kp on
.us 5. Completing final settlement through netting
.br
When final settlement is carried out through netting, the present value of
the receivables of &BANKNAVN. and the borrower is calculated in Danish
kroner or another currency agreed upon. &BANKNAVN.'s and your receivables
are settled so as to constitute one net balance.
.br
Receivables which are secured through a financial security agreement
and other security are written down by the proceeds from security
enforced. The calculated receivables are then included in the final
settlement.
.sp 3mm
.kp off
.kp on
The present value of &BANKNAVN.'s receivables under credit
facilities, such as loans and credits, is the total remaining debt
as at the calculation date, including added unpaid interest plus
interest and costs accrued but not added. The calculation comprises
compensation for capital losses resulting from early repayment and a
preliminary determination of claims according to commitments which
can only be determined at a later date, for example guarantee commitments.
