You can make purchases using your Dankort and Visa/Dankort cards
on the Internet as you can in physical shops.
.sp 3mm
If you wish to use your Dankort or Visa/Dankort to make purchases from
an Internet business, you need to enter your card number, the
card expiry date and the three control digits. When making eDankort
payments, you need to enter the user name and password you normally
use when accessing your netbanking program.

1.¤General advice about making purchases over the Internet
:SKRSLUT.
.sp 3mm
:SWISS8.
:FED.
Read the terms and conditions
:SKRSLUT.
.br
If you wish to purchase something, you should read the purchase terms and
conditions carefully. Make sure that by making this purchase you are not
taking out a subscription or committing to making additional payments if
this is not your intention.
.sp 5mm
:FED.
Save the documentation
:SKRSLUT.
.br
When you have ordered an item, you should save the documentation from the
purchase either in hard-copy format or by making an electronic copy of the
screenshot.
.br
Remember to save both the Web address of the business and the address of
the page that you can use to cancel the purchase or the subscription if
need be.
.sp 3mm
The Internet shop is obliged to issue a receipt for the purchase - in an
email, for example. You must also save this receipt.
.sp 5mm
:FED.
Check the movements on your account statement
:SKRSLUT.
.br
If you have a netbanking agreement, it is easy to check the movements
on your account on an ongoing basis. If you do not have such an
agreement, check your hard-copy account statements carefully. If there
are movements that you do not recognise, contact your bank immediately.
.sp 5mm
:SWISS10.:FED.
2.¤Special advice regarding the use of Dankort and Visa/Dankort cards on
the Internet
:SKRSLUT.
.sp 3mm
:SWISS8.
:FED.
Be careful with your card number
:SKRSLUT.
.br
Never enter your card number unless you are in an actual purchase
situation where you wish to pay for something. Never enter your card
number in other situations, even though the website may ask you to do
so. Never enter your card number as an ID, a part of your 'member
information' or to progress to another site.
.sp 3mm
:FED.
Protection of data in Denmark
:SKRSLUT.
.br
All Danish Internet shops use what is known as SSL encryption to
protect their payment information. It is simple to check whether the
link between your computer and the webshop is secure. If the
connection is secure, you should see a padlock icon in the bottom
right-hand corner of your Internet browser or in front of the URL in green.
Never enter your card
number etc. unless you can see that the connection is secure.
.sp 3mm
:FED.
Protection of data abroad
:SKRSLUT.
.br
You can use your Visa/Dankort card to make purchases from foreign
Internet shops. Some foreign Internet shops still do not use
.us SSL
.ct -encryption
to protect payment information. It is simple to check
whether the link between your computer and the foreign webshop is
secure. If the connection is secure, you should see a padlock icon
in the bottom right-hand corner of your Internet browser
or in front of the URL in green. Never
enter your card number etc. unless you can see that the connection
is secure.
.sp 3mm
:FED.
Subscription arrangements with webshops
:SKRSLUT.
.br
When you enter into a subscription arrangement, you allow the webshop
to transfer sums to the business without you having to perform a
specific action every time. You should therefore review the
criteria for payment under the subscription arrangement very
carefully before entering your card number etc.
.sp 3mm
:FED.
New Dankort or Visa/Dankort card
:SKRSLUT.
.br
When you renew your Dankort or Visa/Dankort card, your card number will
change. If you have entered into any subscription agreements, you must
therefore inform the business in question about your new card number to
allow your subscription to continue without interruption.
