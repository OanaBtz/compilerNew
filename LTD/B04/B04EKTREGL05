&BANKNAVN. will set consumption and credit limits for your

2.3. Issuing and keeping the card, PIN code, etc.
:SKRSLUT.
.br
.us Card
.br
As soon as you receive your physical card, sign it in the signature field
on the reverse side. By signing the card and/or using it for the first
time, you confirm that you have read and accept the card terms and
conditions. Payment recipients will compare the signature on the card
to your signature on the purchase note. You must keep the card in a
safe place. You should check regularly to ensure that your card
or your mobile unit has not gone missing.
.sp 3mm
.kp off
.kp on
.us PIN code
.br
On issuing the physical card, &BANKNAVN. will
send a separate letter containing
the PIN code to your private address. Your PIN code is configured and
printed by machine, to ensure that no-one sees the code before it is
issued to you. You must inform &BANKNAVN. without delay if the letter
containing your PIN code has been opened or is otherwise not intact.
.sp 3mm
When downloading a MasterCard on a mobile phone for a wallet you make your
own PIN code for your virtual card. The PIN code is personal. You can
change your PIN code in your wallet.
.sp 3mm
.kp off
.kp on
You must never store your code together with your card or write it on
the card. You should learn your code by heart and then destroy the
letter containing the code for your physical card.
You cannot be informed of your code through
personal appearance at &BANKNAVN.. If you cannot learn your code off by
heart, you must keep your code in a safe place. You should use a PIN
code reminder, which is available free of charge from any branch of
&BANKNAVN..
.sp 3mm
.kp off
.kp on
.us MasterCard SecureCode
.br
MasterCard SecureCode is the name of an extra measure designed to
prevent the misuse of card data in connection with purchases on
the Internet. There is added security since you must use a one-off
code - in addition to the card - when making purchases on the
Internet. You will receive this code from Nets in a text message
in connection with payment. You will only use this code for
purchases from Internet shops that use MasterCard SecureCode.
.sp
If you are not registered for MasterCard SecureCode, you cannot make
purchases from the relevant shop.
.sp 3mm

.sp 3mm

.kp on
.us Special conditions regarding the card and the registered mobile phone
.br
Since your mobile phone becomes part of the security measures when making
Internet purchases from shops that use MasterCard SecureCode, you must
ensure that others do not have and cannot obtain free access to your card
as well as your mobile phone. Therefore, if you lose the mobile phone on
which you receive one-off codes, you must change/deregister the mobile
phone number with MasterCard SecureCode as soon as possible. If you lose
the card at the same time, you must also block this; see clause 2.8.
.sp 3mm
.kp off

:FED.
2.4. Using your card and PIN code
:SKRSLUT.
.br
Your card and PIN code are for your personal use only.
.sp 3mm
When you use the card, you must either enter your PIN code or sign a
receipt, except for the below mentioned situations where use of pin code
is not necessary. When you enter your PIN code, make sure that no-one can
learn it. Never enter your PIN code via a telephone or in connection with
a telephone answering machine, never use it in connection with the
Internet or other forms of communication that would allow others to
read or 'overhear' it.
.sp 3mm
.kp off
.kp on
Never sign a purchase note on which the sum is incorrect or missing
completely. If you notice that multiple impressions are being taken of
your card, you must make sure that all impressions that are not used
are destroyed. If you allow a business to debit an extra sum from your
card - to cover a tip, for example - make sure that you receive a
receipt stating the full amount.
.sp 3mm

:FED.
Purchases via the Internet
:SKRSLUT.
.br
If you use your card to make purchases on the Internet, you must make
sure that all payment information - including your card number - is
encrypted through the use of SSL or similar. If the shop uses
MasterCard SecureCode, you must also enter the one-off code you will
receive in a text message from Nets in connection with the purchase. You
should print a copy of the screenshot stating the sum you are to pay. This
can be used to check your account statement.
.sp 3mm

Mail order purchases
:SKRSLUT.
.br
When making mail order purchases, you need to sign the order form to
confirm that the company is allowed to deduct the sum from your card
account. When you state your
card number orally or in writing with the purpose of having the
transaction charged to your card, this is considered approval of the
transaction.

Self-service machines without PIN code
:SKRSLUT.

code. These include, for example, toll payments on the Great Belt

some car park ticket machines.
.sp 3mm

Contactless payment
:SKRSLUT.
.br
Contactless payment can take place on payment terminals set up as
contactless.
.sp 3mm
Using contactless cards or MasterCard on mobile phone,
payment can be made without physical contact with
the terminal and without the use of pin code or signature for payments.
There is a limit to the size of the amount you are allowed to pay for each
transaction without having to enter your PIN code.
For payments above the current payment limit, payments can also be made
without direct physical contact to the payment terminal, but only by using
the PIN code.
.sp 3mm
.kp off
.kp on
For security reasons - and regardless of the size of the payment - you
will be asked to use the chip on your physical card
and your pin code regularly.
If you use MasterCard on mobile phone, you will be asked to enter the PIN
code.
.sp 3mm
.kp off
.kp on
For contactless payments without pin code &BANKNAVN. can adjust the
payment limit without notice, unless the limit is raised or reduced
more than 50 % within the calendar year. The current limit is

Prior registration of card data
:SKRSLUT.
.br
It is possible to register your card data with a specific business or with
a digital wallet provider. Then you need not enter your card data when
confirming future purchases from the business/provider in question.
You must follow the directions of the business or wallet provider in
question.
.sp 3mm
You can also agree with the business in question that your card data are
registered with the business for use in connection with payment of a
subscription. The business in question will withdraw the agreed
subscription payments, thus, you need not confirm each single payment.
.sp 3mm
If you have used your card number to pay a continuous service - such
as a subscription - you must make sure to inform the payment recipient
in writing if you wish to terminate the subscription or cease to pay
by card. You should always make sure that you receive written
confirmation of orders and cancellations. When you make a purchase, you
will normally receive a receipt stating the date, sum and card number.
.sp 3mm
