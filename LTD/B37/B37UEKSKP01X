Should your information on country and city of birth, citizenship and tax
duty imply other countries than Denmark, are you obliged to give further
details, for instance tax identification number. In such cases
&BANKNAVN. are obliged to forward such information to The Danish Tax
Authorities, who in turn can forward the information to other countries.
.sp
:FED.
What is a tax identification number?
:SKRSLUT.
.br
A tax identification number is a number which is used to identify the
individual tax payer. In Denmark your tax identification number is
identical with your social security number. Other countries have
special tax identification numbers which are only applicable in
connection with tax. Such numbers are often named TIN which stands
for Tax Identification Number.
.sp
:FED.
When does one typically have a tax identification number in another
country?
:SKRSLUT.
.br
Say you own a summer house in Sweden - you will typically have a
Swedish tax identification number. Often it will be presented on the
land tax bill. Or say you are a German citizen - the tax
identification number will be evident in your German passport.
.sp
:FED.
If I have a tax identification number and/or citizenship in another
country should I pay tax to that country?
:SKRSLUT.
.br
Not necessarily. It depends on the agreements that Denmark has entered
with the country in question. Each country has its own rules of tax
liability. In most cases, you will be liable to tax in your country of
residence, but exceptional circumstances may imply that you are liable to
tax in more than one country. In some cases, you will for example, in
terms of tax, automatically be fiscally based in the country you were
born, e.g. the USA. The bank does not offer you any advice on which
country(ies) you are liable to tax. If you are unsure, we recommend that
you ask an accountant's or tax expert's advice.
.sp
:FED.
What happens if I am fiscally based in another country than Denmark?
:SKRSLUT.
.br
Denmark has entered into an agreement to share tax information with a wide
number of countries, including but not limited to, the EU and the USA. If
you are a citizen of or in any other way fiscally based in one of the
countries with which Denmark has entered into an agreement in terms of
tax, &BANKNAVN. must in some cases inform the Danish Tax Authorities about
your customer relationship to live up to the Danish tax law. This
information may for example include your identification data, your foreign
tax identification number, if any, balances of your bank accounts and
value of deposits. The Danish Tax Authorities will disclose such
information to the relevant country.
.sp
:FED.
What will happen if I don't fill in Certificate on tax notification duty?
:SKRSLUT.
.br
Should you decline to fill in Certificate on tax notification duty, with
all the requested details, &BANKNAVN. must report your identification
details - in the same manner as if you were fiscally based in
another country - to The Danish Tax Authorities who in turn will
forward the information to the relevant country.
