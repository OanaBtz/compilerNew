Type ENUIDNT on the command line. The system responds with a message,
indicating your user ID and the terminal ID.
 
ENUIDNT is an ATD, which invokes program FSNASF1 with the parameter
DXBFNCT, having the value IDNT.
The function code "HELP" as value of parameter DXBFNCT invokes
Application Support Facility V3 in help mode:
 
o  Return is made to the calling application
 
o  No commandline is displayed
Type ENUCOPA on the command line. A prompt panel is displayed, prompting
you to enter the code page you want to work with. After typing an
accepted code page value and pressing Enter, the system works with the
specified code page.
ENUCOPA is only of relevance, when the systems assumptions for the actual
code page are wrong.
 
ENUCOPA is an ATD, which invokes program FSNASF1 with the parameter
DXBCPID.
