When migrating from from one of the program products
 
o  IPDT R1 or R2
o  Application Support Facility V1 or V2
o  OfficeVision/MVS R1 or R2
 
to Application Support Facility V3, the GIL database MUST be migrated with
the program FSNMGIL for the following reasons:
 
o  Build of an alternate index
o  New record fields for support of the workstation feature
o  Extension of date fields to include the century
o  Record key stored in code page 500
o  Provide reserved space of future program enhancements
 
FSNMGIL does NOT migrate PDR names or PDR references in ATDs. Migration
needs to be done by the customer, supported by the new list function of
Application Support Facility V3.
The following is a list of reserved PDR names, which have changed with
Application Support Facility V3. The new PDRs are delivered with the
product. The old ones will be migrated through FSNMGIL, but they have no
longer any purpose. Adapt the default values of the new PDRs where
necessary.

After migration of the GIL from one of the predecessor products through
FSNMGIL, use the GIL list function of Application Support Facility V3
to list all ATDs, calling the program DXBJGLM.
Use the "C" line command to get into the maintenance for each of the
listed ATDs.
