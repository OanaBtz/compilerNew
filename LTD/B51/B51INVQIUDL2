We have previously contacted you regarding the new tax rules imposed
by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  of the United States. In our letter
we explained that it is our duty to inform the American tax authorities of
any dividend or interest income you may have received from any American
Securities being or having been on deposit with SEB.
.sp2
To that extend we forwarded a declaration for you signature in order
that you depending upon your tax status may benefit from a reduction
of tax from 30% to 15% on dividend and interest income from your
American Securities.
For your information we have attached a copy of our original mailing.
.sp
It is imperative that you sign and return the attached declaration, within
15 days in order that we may comply with the new IRS rules.

Rules of Taxation for Owners of American Securities
:SKRSLUT.
.sp2
:DUTCH12.
Effective January 1, 2001 The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the United
States
imposed new tax rules regarding income derived from American Securities.
These changes apply among other things to dividend and interest income.
.sp2
SEB A/S is under obligation to provide you with the following information.
.sp
Being the owner of American Securities in custody with SEB A/S you
are kindly requested to fill in and return the attached declaration
indicating where you aresubject to taxation and if you are a citizen
of the United States of America.
.sp
According to the new rules, SEB A/S will as custodian be obligated to
withhold 30% in income tax on incomes derived from American Securities.
.sp
However, as SEB A/S has entered into a Qualified Intermediary Agreement
with the IRS we have obtained withholding tax relief equal to the
applicable tax rate agreed upon under the dual taxation agreement entered
into between the United States and the country in which the individual
 is subject to taxation.
.sp
For individuals who are subject to Danish Tax, the withholding tax will
according to the dual taxation agreement be 15% on stock dividend and
0% on income derived from bonds.
.sp
In a situation where an individual is subject to taxation in another
country than Denmark SEB will withhold income tax answering to the
agreement between the United States and the country of the individual.
.sp
If you are a citizen of the United States special rules apply.
.sp2
You are kindly requested at your earliest convenience to sign and return
the attached declaration.
.sp
If the declaration is not returned to us, SEB A/S is obligated to withhold
up to 31% tax on income derived from all your American Securities.
.sp
For SEB A/S to comply with the regulations from the IRS we ask that
you immediately upon any change of you tax status inform SEB in writing.
