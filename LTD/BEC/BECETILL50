The repayment value is calculated on the basis of a reference rate (see
below). The rate used in connection with early repayments is &REFRENT. % at
the time of entering into the agreement. Examples of repayment amounts at
various interest rates are shown at the end of this addendum.
.sp 3mm
The special terms and conditions mean that, if the loan is repaid before
the agreed maturity date, it must be repaid at an amount that may be higher
or lower than the outstanding loan balance recorded. If the interest level
(the market rate) has fallen after the agreement has been entered into, the
repayment amount may be higher than the outstanding loan balance recorded.
If the interest level has increased by more than 0.25 percentage point
after the agreement has been entered into, the repayment amount may be
lower than the outstanding loan balance recorded.
.sp 3mm
The rules apply regardless of whether the debtor on its own initiative
decides to repay the loan early, or whether &BANKNAVN. demands repayment of
the loan due to termination or default.

Reference rate
:SKRSLUT.
.br
At the time of entering into the agreement, the reference rate is
calculated as the average effective bond yield before tax for government
bonds etc. This is currently published on the website of &BØRSNAVN. under
'Stat, fiskeri & Færøerne' (Government, fisheries & the Faroe Islands):
www.nasdaqomxnordic.com/obligationer/danmark/rentegennemsnit/.
.br
The interval for the maturity period corresponding to the term of the
fixed-rate agreement is applied.
.sp 3mm
In case of repayment before the agreed date, the reference rate is
calculated in a manner similar to that applied when the agreement was
entered into. However, the rate applicable on the day before the
calculation of the repayment amount will be used together with the maturity
interval corresponding to the remaining term of the fixed-rate agreement.
.sp 3mm
If the average bond yield is no longer included in the official list of
&BØRSNAVN., &BANKNAVN has the right to use another reference rate which is
representative of the market rate. The same applies if &BANKNAVN believes
that the average bond yield is no longer representative of market rate
trends.
