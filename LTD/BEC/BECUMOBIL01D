Unless otherwise stated, the rules for Mobile Money are applicable to both
the account holder and the user. The account holder may be the user, but it
is possible for an account holder to associate other users. In the event
that the account holder associates other users, the account holder must
ensure that the users are informed of these rules. If the account holder is
legally incapable, he cannot associate other users. The use of Mobile Money
is subject to an agreement being concluded between &BANKNAVN. and the
account holder on the use of Mobile Money for the mobile number in
question.
.sp 3mm
.kp off
.kp on
:FED.
Please note
:SKRSLUT.
that the entire mobile number is printed on bank statements and
shop receipts. This also applies to unlisted numbers.
.br
:FED.
Please note
:SKRSLUT.
that the mobile number can only be associated to one account. If
at a later time an agreement is concluded where the mobile number
in question is associated to another account, e.g. in another
bank, the original agreement will be terminated.
.sp 3mm
.kp off
.kp on
Payments with Mobile Money are effected using the mobile phone. Only the
mobile number stated in the agreement can be used to pay for goods and
services with Mobile Money.
.sp 3mm
.kp off
.kp on
Only the registered user can use the mobile number to make purchases using
Mobile Money.
.sp 3mm
.kp off
.kp on
If the account holder or the user no longer wishes to use Mobile Money or
the mobile number is no longer used by the user, e.g. if the mobile phone
is sold, the number is changed or the subscription is discontinued, the
account holder must ensure that the agreement on Mobile Money is
terminated. If the agreement is not terminated, there may be a risk that
any new user of the mobile number will be able to use the number to make
payments from the associated account. If the mobile number for Mobile Money
has not been used for two months, the agreement will terminate
automatically.
.sp 3mm
.kp off
.kp on
Please note that there may be restrictions on use of Mobile Money abroad as
well as on the Faroe Islands and in Greenland. This e.g. means that a
mobile telephone with a Danish number (+45 xxxx xxxx) cannot be used to
order goods and services via short codes in a shop abroad (including the
Faroe Islands and Greenland). The shop may refer to another method for
payment, e.g. that orders must be sent via a text message to a complete
telephone number including country code.

1.1 Purchases in shops
:SKRSLUT.
.sp 3mm
Mobile Money is a payment instrument, which can be used for payment of
goods and services in shops that accept Mobile Money. You can only make
purchases for the amount available in the associated account. Purchases can
only be made in Danish kroner (DKK).
.sp 3mm
.kp off
.kp on
&BANKNAVN. has set a general maximum limit for use of Mobile Money. This
maximum can be seen when establishing the agreement. The set maximum limit
depends on whether the user is older or younger than 15 years of age. The
account holder may set lower maximum limit than the general maximum limit
set by &BANKNAVN.. In the event of changes to the maximum limit, the
originally concluded agreement will still apply.
.sp 3mm
Mobile Money may not be used for any illegal purposes.
.sp 3mm

:FED.
1.2 Restrictions on use
:SKRSLUT.
.sp 3mm
Mobile Money cannot be used in the situations described in clause 8. If
&BANKNAVN. and/or &BANKNAVN.'s technical centres are involved in a
labour conflict, notification of the start and end of such conflict will be
made as quickly as possible.
.sp 3mm

2. Use of Mobile Money

In order to make payments with Mobile Money, the following procedure must
be observed:
.sp 3mm
*¤Follow
.in 5mm nobreak
the instructions from the shop when purchasing goods or services
.in 0mm
.kp off
.kp on
*¤The user
.in 5mm nobreak
will receive a request for acceptance of the purchase as well as of the
size of the amount via e.g. a text message. The instructions from the shop
for acceptance of the purchase must be observed.
.in 0mm
.sp 3mm
.kp off
.kp on
:KURSIV.
Receipt
:SKRSLUT.
.br
The user will receive a confirmation of the payment transaction from the
shop showing that the transaction has been completed. The receipt will be
sent by text message, by letter, email or another durable medium. The shop
will provide information about how the receipt is sent, when it is not sent
by text message.
.sp 3mm
.kp off
.kp on
The receipt from the shop will show, inter alia, mobile number, the name of
the shop, amount and date. The user should ensure that the amount is in
accordance with the purchase made. In the event of errors on the receipt,
the shop must be contacted immediately. The receipt should as a minimum be
stored until the account holder has checked the entries in the account.
.sp 3mm
.kp off
.kp on
:KURSIV.
Revocation
:SKRSLUT.
.br
Payments which have been approved by the user cannot be revoked. See,
however, clauses 11 and 12 regarding the possibility of reversing a
payment.
.sp 3mm
.kp off
.kp on
:KURSIV.
Reservation and withdrawal of amounts from the account
:SKRSLUT.
.br
The purchase amount will be reserved in the account once the user has
approved the payment. This means that transactions can no longer be made
using the reserved amount. From the time of &BANKNAVN.'s receipt of the
payment order from the shop, the amount will be withdrawn from the account
no later than the following business day. However, Handelsbanken may at any
time, without incurring liability, refuse to effect payments, transfers,
etc. where the restrictions agreed with &BANKNAVN. are not observed or
where the funds available in the account are insufficient for a transfer.
.br
The reservation will be deleted automatically after 14 calendar days if the
amount has not yet been withdrawn from the account.
.sp 3mm
.kp off
.kp on
:KURSIV
Subscription
:SKRSLUT.
.br
It is possible to pay for subscriptions using Mobile Money. The user must
approve each individual withdrawal. The shop will subsequently request the
user to approve the specific transaction via Mobile Money before the next
payment can be made according to the subscription agreement.

3. Safekeeping of the mobile phone
:SKRSLUT.
.sp 3mm
:SWISS8.
Please be aware that Mobile Money via the registered mobile phone can be
used for direct withdrawals from the account associated with the Mobile
Money agreement. In order to prevent misuse of Mobile Money, the mobile
phone must be kept so as to prevent others from using Mobile Money.
.br
If technically possible on the mobile phone, a code should be used in order
to prevent unauthorised use. This could e.g. be a key lock with code
digits. The code must not be disclosed to anyone.

.sp 3mm
If the account holder wishes that another person (user) is to be able to
make payments using Mobile Money from the account, the user's mobile number
must be registered for Mobile Money. The user's purchases via Mobile Money
have the same legal effects as if the purchases had been made by the
account holder and according to these rules for Mobile Money. When
registering another person (user), the account holder also consents to the
registered user initiating payment transactions within the maximum limit
for Mobile Money agreed between the account holder and &BANKNAVN. to the
effect that the account holder becomes liable for such payment
transactions.
.sp 3mm

rules.

The account holder is liable for transactions made using Mobile Money, see,
however, clause 7. The account holder must therefore take note of his
obligation to check entries in the account regularly. And therefore it
should be agreed with users how the account holder's check of the user's
transactions can take place, see clause 10.
.sp 3mm

If a user is no longer to be able to make payments with Mobile Money from
the account, the account holder must ensure that the Mobile Money agreement
for the mobile number in question is deregistered.

date of birth, mobile number to be blocked and which bank the Mobile Money
agreement is associated with in order to have Mobile Money frozen
immediately for the mobile telephone in question.
.br
Once Mobile Money has been frozen by the account holder or user,
documentation regarding the freezing will be sent by letter to the account
holder. If the account holder has registered for &WEBSYSNAVN., the
documentation will, however, be sent as a message in &WEBSYSNAVN., where
where it will be available for 18 months after the freezing was initiated.
