When you use your MasterCard to make a purchase or withdraw cash, the
sum is 'reserved' on your account as soon as &BANKNAVN. is notified
of the transaction. This means that the sum reserved is no longer at
your disposal. The sum is withdrawn from your account as soon as
&BANKNAVN. has received the payment demand from the payment
recipient. When you withdraw cash from &BANKNAVN.'s own ATMs and
branches in Denmark, the sum is withdrawn from your account straight away.
.sp 3mm
.kp off

Please note that when you use your card to make purchases on the
Internet or via mail and
telephone orders, the payment recipient is normally not allowed to
withdraw the sum until your goods have been shipped.  If you make
purchases where payment in advance has been agreed - when you buy
airline or concert tickets, for example - the payment recipient
may, however, withdraw the amount as soon as you have booked your
journey or reserved your tickets. You cannot use your card to
withdraw more money than you have on your account. We will
therefore reject payment requests if you do not have sufficient
funds on your account.

As soon as you receive the physical card, sign it in the signature field
on the reverse side. By signing the card and/or using it for the first
time, you confirm that you have read and accept the card terms and
conditions. Payment recipients will compare the signature on the
card to your signature on the purchase note. You must keep the card
and mobile unit in a safe place. You should check regularly to ensure
that your card or your mobile unit has not gone missing.

On issuing the physical
card, &BANKNAVN. will send a separate letter containing
the PIN code to your private address. Your PIN code is configured and
printed by machine, to ensure that no-one sees the code before it is
issued to you. You must inform &BANKNAVN. without delay if the letter
containing your PIN code has been opened or is otherwise not intact.

You must never store your code together with your card or write it on

letter containing the code for your physical card.
You cannot be informed of your code through

heart, you must keep your code in a safe place. You should use a PIN
code reminder, which is available free of charge from any branch of
&BANKNAVN..

MasterCard SecureCode is the name of an extra measure designed to
prevent the misuse of card data in connection with purchases on
the Internet. There is added security since you must use a one-off
code - in addition to the card - when making purchases on the
Internet. You will receive this code from Nets in a text message
in connection with payment. You will only use this code for
purchases from Internet shops that use MasterCard SecureCode.

purchases from the relevant shop.

.br
Since your mobile phone becomes part of the security measures when making
Internet purchases from shops that use MasterCard SecureCode, you must
ensure that others do not have and cannot obtain free access to your card
as well as your mobile phone. Therefore, if you lose the mobile phone on
which you receive one-off codes, you must change/deregister the mobile
phone number with MasterCard SecureCode as soon as possible. If you lose
the card at the same time, you must also block this; see clause 2.8.

receipt, except for the below mentioned situations where use of pin code
is not necessary. When you enter your PIN code, make sure that no-one can
learn it. Never enter your PIN code via a telephone or in connection with
a telephone answering machine, never use it in connection with the

a subscription - you must make sure to inform the payment recipient in
