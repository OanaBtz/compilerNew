&BANKNAVN. advertises in the daily newspapers or provides written or
electronic notification in case of interest rate changes and price
changes.  Significant price changes or the introduction of new prices must
be notified by means of individual communication. The reason for
making the changes will be stated.

:SWISS8.
.sp 3mm
If a payment is not settled at the latest on due date, or an overdraft
facility is overdrawn, &BANKNAVN. is entitled to impose interest for
late payment/overdraft interest. Interest for late payment/overdraft
interest is calculated on the amount overdue/the overdraft. The interest
for late payment/overdraft interest is calculated based on the rate stated
in the credit agreement. The rate is variable from due date/overdraft till
payment takes place.

The interest for late payment/overdraft interest is subject to change in
the same way as other changes in interest.

In case of overdraft or overdue payment, a reminder fee may accrue.
Reminder fee and other default charges appear from &BANKNAVN.'s price
list. If a debt is referred to collection action, any costs for legal
assistance, court, etc. will be accrued. Overdraft may result in the
cancellation of the credit agreement, just as overdraft and non-repayment
may imply that it will be difficult to obtain credit. Termination of the
credit agreement will lead to increased credit rates and charges.

&BANKNAVN. may at any time decide to cease compounding of non-performing
loans and credits, administratively and financially.

If compounding is ceased, and this has not been agreed with you, it does
not mean that &BANKNAVN. waives its right to receive interest of its
claims and to have any subsequent expenses covered. This also

compounding has been ceased.
